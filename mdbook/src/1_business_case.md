# Business Case <!-- 850 words: Root Cause Analysis ~450 + Solution & Goal ~400 -->

The client engagement is based on modernising how council services are developed, supported and delivered to the public.

The council recognises that legacy systems cannot be supported indefinitely and that new service delivey is hampered by outdated software development processes and tools.  

## Root Cause Analysis

While there are many ways to analyse the current state of the organisation (Phillips, 2026) SWOT, PESTLE etc. they have some limitations in this scenario.

SWOT looks at strengths and weaknesses but doesn't particularly handle conflicting perspectives. Pestle focuses on external inputs but we're discussing an internal transformation projects and Porter's Five Forces are primarily based on assumptions about a competitive market place, similar to SC Analysis.

CATWOE (Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owners and Environment) analysis is geared towards "messy" problems (Umbrex 2026) in public bodies where stakeholders hold different opinions and priorities as to what's important.

CATWOE seeks to surface various stakeholders assumptions amid changing political, budgetary, technical and service delivery constraints.

Problem Analysis, Business Transformation types, and Internal/External factors

This section should: 
 
●  Illustrate the context. 
●  State and discuss the problem. 
●  Include a problem statement that clearly defines the scope and focus of the business problem you will investigate.
●  Analyze business transformation types relevant to the problem.
●  Identify internal and external factors affecting the organization.

### Problem Analysis

Applying the CATWOE framework, the transformation can be defined as the moving from a set of legacy services to a platform that empowers service delivery, speeds it up and maintains security and trust in the organisation.

Different stakeholders have other perceptions based on their wordlview, for examples Developers see the issues in terms of technical debt, manual deployment processes and supporting legacy software. 

Finance team members (and executives) look through a lens of cost and sustainability as well as an inability to react to changing policies in time.

Service managers would love the focus to be on customer experience and ease of support of the services as well as the security concerns that come with running something that's public facing. 

The problem statement must consider all of these perspectives: *The council's current software development practices are insufficiently standardised, poorly governed and difficult to secure, resulting in slow service delivery, escalating costs and exposure to risk.*

### Business Transformation Types


<!-- 

Development Process Improvement	

- Development process improvement refers to changes in how software is planned, developed, tested, and deployed. This includes adopting new methodologies (like Agile or DevOps), implementing CI/CD pipelines, or improving quality assurance practices.

Software Transformation Process	

- Specifically focuses on changes or upgrades made to an organisation's software systems, applications, development processes, and technical infrastructure. This could involve modernising legacy systems, implementing new development methodologies, or adopting cloud-native architectures.

### Internal Factors

#### Adopting Best Practice



### External Factors

#### Security

Security is one of the key external factors driving the adoption of a standard set of practices, development environments, deployment pipelines and other tools.

"Highly Significant" cyber attacks rose by 50% in 2025 (Booth, 2025) alongside the ramping up of malicious activity by 

## Solution & Goal

We propose adopting Platform Engineering practices through the deployment of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). Platform Engineering, according to juliakm (2023), is "a practice built up from DevOps principles that seeks to improve each development team's security, compliance, costs, and time-to-business value through improved developer experiences and self-service within a secure, governed framework. It's both product-based mindset shift and a set of tools and systems to support it."

Solution Consideration, SMART Goal Statement, and Justification

This section should:
●  Argue why the transformation solution is needed.  
●  Demonstrate the impact it could have on the organization.
●  Create a core goal (SMART Goal Statement) for the project.
●  Provide justification for the chosen solution.
